# Multiplatform building

## Self-contained

One of the things I learned while working on games at the company I work at, is package management can be hell if the packages are not set up correctly.

A crucial thing to consider is that your package doesn't get used in isolation. The place where this is the most irritating is building. Are you sure that you know better how to build your plugin for all platforms and how to make sure it doesn't get built for other platforms?
